## 🔌 Official React Plugins

Vite provides two official plugins for React:

### 1️⃣ @vitejs/plugin-react
- Uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh

## 🧠 React Compiler (Optional)

The **React Compiler** is not enabled by default due to its impact on development and build performance.

To enable it, follow the official guide:

## 🧹 ESLint & TypeScript Recommendation

For **production applications**, it is recommended to:
